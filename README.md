# Face Identifier
A program to identify and mark faces in a given picture

## How to use

- use pipenv to install all requirements (recommended)
- make three folders, one for known faces called faces, one for input files named input that you need to process and the last one for processed images called output in the same directory that main.py is in
- the folders can be changed in the code, they are global variables
- run the code once you have the folders setup for results
